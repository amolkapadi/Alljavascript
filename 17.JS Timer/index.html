    <!-- JavaScript Timer-
    In JavaScript, a timer is created to execute a task or 
    any function at a particular time. Basically, the timer is used to delay 
    the execution of the program or to execute the JavaScript code in a regular 
    time interval.With the help of timer, we can delay the execution of the code.
    Two timer functions setInterval() and setTimeout().


    1.setTimeout()-
    The setTimeout() method executes a block of code after the specified time. 
    The method executes the code only once. 
    The setTimeout() function helps the users to delay the execution of code. 
    The setTimeout() method accepts two parameters in which one is a user-defined 
    function,and another is the time parameter to delay the execution. The time parameter holds 
    the time in milliseconds (1 second = 1000 milliseconds), which is optional to pass.

    <!--Example setTimeOut-->
    <!-- <button onclick="setTimeout(Demo,2000);">Click me</button>
    <script>
        function Demo(){
            alert("This is a setTimeout Timer ")
        }
    </script> -->


    <!-- 2.setInterval()-
    The setInterval method is a bit similar to the setTimeout() function.
    It executes the specified function repeatedly after a time interval.
    Or we can simply say that a function is executed repeatedly after a specific
    amount of time provided by the user in this function.
    For example - Display updated time in every five seconds. -->
    <!--Example setTimeEnterval-->
    <button onclick="setInterval(Demo,2000);">Click me</button>
    <script>
        function Demo() {
            alert("This is a setTimeout Timer ")
        }
    </script>
