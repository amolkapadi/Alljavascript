<body>

    <!-- Destructuring means to break down a complex structure into simpler parts. 
    With the syntax of destructuring, you can extract smaller fragments from objects 
    and arrays.It can be used for assignments and declaration of a variable.
    Destructuring is an efficient way to extract multiple values from
    data that is stored in arrays or objects.
    When destructuring an array, we use their positions (or index) in an assignment. -->


    <script>
        var skill=["html","css","js","reactjs"];
        document.write(skill + "<br>");
        
        document.write(skill[0] + " " + skill[1]+ " " +skill[2] +"<br>");
        //Array destructuring:-
        var [a,b,c]=skill;
        document.write(`${a} ${b} ${c}`);
